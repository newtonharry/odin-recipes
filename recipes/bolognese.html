    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a recipe for a bolognese dish</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound ground turkey</li>
      <li>¾ cup chopped carrots</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped celery</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground thyme</li>
      <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
      <li>2 cups tomato sauce</li>
      <li>½ cup tomato juice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
      <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add ground turkey and cook
        until well browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add carrots, onion, celery, garlic,
        thyme, and red pepper flakes. Cook and stir until vegetables are tender,
        5 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard grease, if necessary. Add white wine;
        cook and stir until almost completely evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add
        tomato sauce, tomato juice, and parsley. Reduce heat and simmer until
        sauce reaches a thick consistency, about 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook,
        stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11
        minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Add the sauce and Parmesan cheese;
        mix well. Season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
    </ol>
